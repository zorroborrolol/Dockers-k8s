**DOCKER AND KUBERNETES**<br/>
This project delves into the world of containerization and container orchestration. You'll start by creating a Docker image for a simple web application. Docker allows you to package your application and its dependencies into a portable and self-contained unit, ensuring consistency across different environments. Next, you'll deploy this Docker image to a Kubernetes cluster. Kubernetes is a powerful platform for managing containerized applications, providing features like automated deployment, scaling, and self-healing. This project introduces you to the core concepts of containerization and Kubernetes, essential technologies for modern cloud-native application development.
